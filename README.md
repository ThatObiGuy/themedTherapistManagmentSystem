## Overview

A comprehensive Simpsons-themed therapist management application that combines multiple web development disciplines into a cohesive full-stack project. This system enables users to manage therapists, appointments, and patient information within an engaging interface inspired by The Simpsons television show. The project represents the fourth installment in my web development learning series, consolidating skills from previous projects into a complete solution.

## Features

- Therapist profile management
- Patient record tracking and appointment scheduling
- Interactive SVG elements for visual engagement
- Database with relational dependencies and constraints
- Simpsons-themed UI with custom animations
- Complete CRUD functionality throughout the application
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5 - Semantic structure and accessibility
  - CSS3 - Custom animations and responsive styling
  - JavaScript - Dynamic content and interactive elements
  - SVG - Vector graphics for themed illustrations

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js - Server-side JavaScript runtime
  - Express - Web application framework
  - MySQL - Relational database with foreign key constraints
  - RESTful API - Standardized data communication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed locally
- MySQL database system (XAMPP recommended)
- Modern web browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThatObiGuy/themedTherapistManagmentSystem.git
   ```

2. Set up the database:
   - Start MySQL through XAMPP
   - Import the database schema from the SQL files in the repository
   - Database includes initial Simpsons-themed data for testing

3. Install dependencies and start the application:
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd backend
   npm install
   node server.js
   ```
   
   ```bash
